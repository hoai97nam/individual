## Most common rxjs operators

We will not separate into groups, this is sorted as ascending

### combineLatest: 
adapts Array<Observable> as input, will emit a value when obseravble elements (children observables) have at least 1 inner emission of each (children observables need for completion) and **in order**
 
 ![combineLatest]({{site.baseurl}}/img/combineLatest.png)

### concat:
combine multiple observables, but you want their emissions to be **in a specific order**, one after the other. children observables will emit only the previous one has completed.
 ![concat.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/concat.png)
### merge:
  combines output of independent observable into a single stream. Emit values as soon as any of the observables emit a value (different from combineLatest or withLatestFrom).
