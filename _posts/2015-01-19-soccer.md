## Most common rxjs operators

We will not separate into groups, this is sorted as ascending

### combineLatest: 
adapts Array<Observable> as input, will emit a value when obseravble elements (children observables) have at least 1 inner emission of each (children observables need for completion) and **in order**
 
 ![combineLatest]({{site.baseurl}}/img/combineLatest.png)

### concat:
combine multiple observables, but you want their emissions to be **in a specific order**, one after the other. children observables will emit only the previous one has completed.
 ![concat.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/concat.png)
### merge:
  combines output of independent observable into a single stream. Emit values as soon as any of the observables emit a value (different from combineLatest or withLatestFrom).
  ![merge.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/merge.png)
### withLatestFrom:
  Where the primary observable takes the lead and other observables chime in with their most recent values. `withLatestFrom` only emits a value when the main observable emits, and after each additional observable has emitted at least once.
  ![withLatestFrom.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/withLatestFrom.png)
### from:
  - convert a promise to an observable
  - convert arrays and iterables as a sequence
### catch:
  Catches errors on the observable and return a new observable or throwing an error.
![catch.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/catch.png)

### filter:
  filter will emit values that meet the specified condition. If no values in the observable satisfy the condition, nothing gets
![filter.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/filter.png)

### takeUntil:
  use other emission to unsubcribe main observable

### share:
  .Related to side effect via `tap` operator
